# 🛒 E-commerce Inventory Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a C++ based E-commerce Inventory Management System designed to demonstrate the practical implementation of fundamental Data Structures.

The system efficiently manages product inventory, customer orders, and inventory operations using:

- Singly Linked List (SLL)
- Queue (FIFO)
- Stack (LIFO)

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1️⃣ Inventory Management (Singly Linked List)
- Add new products
- Delete products
- Update product details
- Display product inventory
- Each product contains:
  - Product ID
  - Name
  - Price
  - Quantity

### 2️⃣ Order Processing (Queue - FIFO)
- Manages customer orders in First-In-First-Out order
- Ensures fair and sequential order handling

### 3️⃣ Undo Operations (Stack - LIFO)
- Tracks inventory changes
- Allows undoing the last operation
- Implements Last-In-First-Out logic

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (SLL, Queue, Stack)

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Practical implementation of Linked List
- Understanding FIFO and LIFO concepts
- Applying data structures in real-world scenarios
- Strengthening problem-solving skills
